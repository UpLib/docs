# Executive

## Executive Summary

The Cabinet heads the Executive power in Liberland. It is strictly limited only to a narrow list of powers. There are only four Ministries. The Executive Branch is responsible to the Legislative Branch. The Senate and the People can veto regulations of the Executive. No mandatory taxes may be collected, and budgets are very restrictive; the Cabinet must ask the People to provide funding voluntarily on a per-project basis. The whole of the Executive works for the benefit of individual life, liberty and property.

## The Cabinet

The Cabinet is the supreme organ of the Executive, and it is formed by the Prime Minister and consists of four Ministers. The Cabinet decides collectively, and votes are counted upon a one-Minister-one-vote basis. The Prime Minister provides the decisive vote in case of a draw.

## Decrees

The Cabinet issues Decrees which are Regulations binding upon the whole Executive Branch. They can be binding upon the people in a limited fashion only, strictly within the boundaries of the Law.

## Limits of Power

The Cabinet may only decide upon the matters regarding foreign affairs, conduct commerce on behalf of Liberland, and regulate that which the Law demands that it should regulate. It supervises the day-to-day state affairs in the broadest sense. In general, it acts only to safeguard individuals' life, liberty, and property, and any action of the Executive which is not oriented towards this goal is automatically unconstitutional.

## Limited Regulation

Congress can contest all the Regulations the Cabinet or the Ministeries draft. They can be vetoed at any time by the Senate and the People. In addition, should they be found unconstitutional or illegal, the Courts can declare them invalid.

## The Prime Minister

The Prime Minister heads the Cabinet and has the deciding vote during its deliberations. They are a Representative chosen to be the Prime Minister by the Congress (the Legislative Branch) for up to 5 years. The Legislative Branch can remove the Prime Minister and any other Minister. The Prime Minister chooses and dismisses the other Ministers and has insight into all the operations of all the ministries and agencies of the Government. The Prime Minister has no ministry of their own but is the ‘political’ minister, the official representing the Cabinet as a whole.

## Ministries

There are four and only four ministries, each headed by a Minister:

* the Ministry of Justice
* the Ministry of Internal Affairs
* the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and
* the Ministry of Finance. The Constitution defines each of the ministries and enumerates their powers.

## Edicts

Ministers can issue Edicts which are regulations pertaining to their sphere of influence, binding for the Government and others only within the strict boundaries of the Law.

## Agencies

Ministries can be further subdivided into Agencies, but only based on a Law that must pass through the Referendum like any other Law. In this way, we can control the “bloating” of our government.

## The Budget

All Budgets must be passed as Laws and, therefore, must be agreed upon by the Legislative Branch (Congress). In addition, budgets and spending proposals need the Senate’s special approval before execution. The Supreme Court can declare a Budget unconstitutional, and such a Budget will not be implemented in its current form.

## Government Projects

Individual government projects will have to be presented to the citizens and investors; they must be convinced that such projects are good for them and Liberland, as the Executive has no way to take away their money in taxes.

## Governing Liberland

The supreme public interest in Liberland is the interest to regulate and improve the protection of individual life, liberty, and property. This means that the government is a public guarantor of the Non-Aggression Principle or the Golden Rule - do not do unto others what you do not want to be done to you. The checks and balances that the Constitution binds the Executive with are here to help it stay focused on this, their main and only job. This makes being a government official or an ‘Agent’ an uneasy but exciting job. The Agents serve the only government currently in existence that doesn’t actively steal resources from the people in the name of the public good. They cooperate in the building of the freest nation on Earth.
