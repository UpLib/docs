#### § 3: Acknowledging Limitations of Service
By consenting to these Terms, you acknowledge that:

a. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse, decline, suspend, or disable your access to or use of the Residency Services through our Know Your Customer (KYC) and/or flagging procedure;

### Art. 3: Public Blockchain
1. No party (neither we nor you), including but not limited to any party involved in, or having contributed to the development of, the Liberland Blockchain and any of the affiliates, directors, employees, contractors, service providers, or agents of such parties, owns or controls the Liberland Blockchain or any accessory, upgrade, related software, or any other modification to it (including, but not limited to, Liberland Blockchain user interface). You are solely and fully responsible for your use of each and any of them.

a) the availability and operability of the Liberland Blockchain and its underlying software;

b) the interoperability of the network with other third-party networks (this largely depends on external factors beyond the Provider’s reasonable control, such as, in particular, the infrastructure and operability of third-party networks and their internet-connectivity measures); or

c) the suitability of the Liberland Blockchain for your own business purposes.

3. You are using the Liberland Blockchain for your own business purposes at your sole and own risk.

### Article 4: Legal and Moral Use
You may use the Residency Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these terms and conditions. You agree not to use the Residency Services:
a) In any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local, or international law or regulation (including, without limitation, any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the US or other countries);
b) For the purpose of exploiting, harming, or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable information or otherwise;
c) To send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use, or re-use any material that does not comply with these terms and conditions;
d) To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material without our prior written consent, including any “junk mail”, “chain letter”, “spam”, or any other similar solicitation;
e) To impersonate or attempt to impersonate Liberland or any affiliated entity, their employee or another agent, another user, or any other person or entity (including, without limitation, by using e-mail addresses or screen names associated with any of the foregoing); and
f) To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Residency Services, or which, as determined by us, may harm Liberland or users of the Residency Services or expose them to liability.
