Access to the Residency Services may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Residency Services from outside Liberland, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.
2. Given that the use or access to the Residency Services outside of Liberland is beyond their contemplated scope, you accept that by such use you waive all our responsibility for the use or its consequences and that all national warranties will likely not apply as well. Such use is fully and completely your own responsibility, and you are likewise solely responsible for all of its consequences, to you or to third parties.

3. You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the internet or the Residency Services will be free of viruses or other destructive code.

### Article 9: Unrecognized Status and Limited Territorial Control

#### § 1: Unrecognized Status of Liberland
You acknowledge and understand that Liberland, in its current state, is not recognized by the United Nations and the vast majority of states, and it does not have full control over its territory. This has significant implications on the level of services Liberland provides as a state. These include, but are not limited to:

a) Partial or total inability to enforce or fulfill its own laws, regulations, promises, stipulations, expectations, etc., in Liberland or abroad;

b) Lack of recognition of its jurisdiction, legislation, legal acts such as agreements and stipulations, policies, etc., by other parties, states, or private entities;

#### § 2: Complete Acknowledgement of All Consequences
1. You participate in the Residency Services with full acknowledgement of this situation and all its consequences.
2. You agree to hold the Provider, Liberland, affiliated entities and companies, and all their officers, employees, contractors, partners, etc., entirely harmless from and against any of your rights, their responsibilities, any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of the above situation of non-recognition.

### Article 10: Services Offered for Demonstrative Purposes
1. As a result of, among other matters, the above situation, Residency Services and all other secondary services, goods provided, and any other service provided by Liberland or the Provider are offered for demonstrative purposes only, to signify the future services of the country upon recognition.
2. You agree to participate in these services on an as-is basis and with the understanding that they are a demonstration of future services only. These services exist to indicate to you what may be possible in the future and are not intended to offer a complete experience or even to satisfy any expectations you may have for such or similar services.
3. You understand that this state of affairs shall persist at least until such time as Liberland gains broad, international recognition, including, but not limited to, Liberland obtaining full control of its land.

## Section 5: Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

### Article 11: Governing Law
These Terms and Conditions, their subject matter, and their formation, as well as any related non-contractual disputes or claims, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Liberland, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of Liberland or any other jurisdiction).

### Article 12: Dispute Resolution
Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions, including any question regarding their existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of the Liberland Arbitration Centre, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Article 9. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Liberland. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.

### Article 13: Mandatory Arbitration
1. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to these terms and conditions or the Residency Services shall be instituted exclusively in Arbitration, and the forum for this arbitration shall be Liberland and its judiciary system. Where this should prove impossible, the Arbitration shall instead take place according to the [enter jurisdiction for arbitration and place].
2. Liberland retains the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these terms and conditions in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

## Section 5: Final Provisions

### Article 13: No Waiver; Severability
1. No waiver by the Provider of any term or condition set forth in these terms and conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Provider to assert a right or provision under these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
2. If any provision of these terms and conditions is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the terms and conditions will continue in full force and effect.

### Article 14: Entire Agreement
1. These Terms and Conditions, along with our Privacy Policy, constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and the Provider with respect to the Residency Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Residency Services.
2. With respect to specific services as are understood under Residency Services, the Provider reserves the right to set up specific Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions supersede the current Terms and Conditions where they differ from them, but the current Terms and Conditions still apply where the service-specific Terms and Conditions remain silent.
