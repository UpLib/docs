<h1 id="sample-markdown">Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2 id="1-definitions">1. Definitions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>DATA CONTROLLER means a natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and how any personal data are or are to be processed. For this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your data.</li>
  <li>DATA PROCESSORS (OR SERVICE PROVIDERS) means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. We may use the services of various Service Providers to process your data more effectively.</li>
  <li>DATA SUBJECT is any living individual who is the subject of Personal Data.</li>
  <li>THE USER is the individual using our Service. The User corresponds to the Data Subject, who is the subject of Personal Data. <h2 id="2-personal-data">2. Personal data</h2>
  </li>
  <li>When we refer to personal data in this Privacy policy, we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, the Data Subject.</li>
  <li>The natural person is not just an abstract “person”. It is a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identification number or one or more factors specific to their physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity and personal history. </li>
  <li>A natural person in this context is an identifiable person; it is a similar concept to the individual as used to determine “individual liberty” in Liberland’s Constitution. </li>
  <li>You may be entitled to ask Liberland for a copy of your personal data, to correct it, erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of the data to other organisations. </li>
  <li>You may also have the right to object to some processing activities, and where we have asked for your consent to process your data, you have the right to withdraw this consent. </li>
  <li>Our commercial messages (such as our newsletters) contain unsubscribe links or similar ways to opt-out from these messages. These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that there is a legal requirement to process your data. If you wish to exercise your rights, you can contact us in writing via the contact details in this Privacy policy <h2 id="3-policy-application">3. Policy application</h2>
  </li>
  <li>This Privacy policy applies to Liberland Services, meaning services and products offered by Liberland, Liberland Limited, the Liberland marketplace, the Liberland App, and any affiliated persons and other entities, hereafter the “Provider”.</li>
  <li>The Provider reserves the right to enact special policies on particular services, and where this happens, the specific policy supersedes this one.</li>
  <li>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other services offered by other persons or entities, including products, vendors, or websites that may include Liberland or Liberland Limited. <h2 id="4-we-need-personal-data-to-deliver-our-services">4. We need personal data to deliver our services</h2>
  </li>
  <li>To deliver Liberland Services to you, the Provider collects, stores, uses and processes your personal data as required by the conditions of that particular service. This Privacy policy or other subsidiary privacy policies where these exist to describe how the Provider collects, stores, uses and processes your personal data. </li>
  <li>Before registering to, purchasing, or entering an agreement about or using Liberland Services, please read the respective contract, agreement or description of services carefully and our Terms and conditions, henceforth &quot;Service agreement&quot;. These describe your rights and obligations as a party purchasing or otherwise obtaining those services. </li>
  <li>Please be mindful that partaking in most Liberland Services requires one to be an E-resident of Liberland, and so the general Terms and Conditions for Liberland.org apply as well. They apply in a subsidiary fashion (where more specific policies are silent), as described in those Terms and conditions. </li>
  <li>For other services, such as the Liberland App, the Terms and Conditions applicable to that service apply, likewise in a subsidiary fashion. Please consider these Terms and conditions a part of the Service agreement unless specifically told otherwise. </li>
  <li>After entering into the respective agreement for a Liberland service or services, you can always choose not to provide your personal data to the Provider. You must inform the Provider of this, or the Provider can&#39;t put your choice can&#39;t be put into effect. </li>
  <li>Providing the different functionalities and maintaining the expected level of service requires the Provider to have access to your personal data. </li>
  <li>Please be mindful that should you choose not to provide your personal data, the Provider can&#39;t guarantee to perform the Liberland services to you as stated in the respective Service agreement. </li>
  <li>Please be mindful that the Provider is at liberty to interpret such a refusal to provide personal data as the same as a request for the regular termination of the Liberland service. This is mainly where the refusal makes it very difficult or impossible to provide the expected level of service and provide the Liberland service regularly. <h2 id="5-we-process-the-following-kinds-of-data-">5.

<h2 id="11-2-caloppa">11.2. CalOPPA</h2>
<ol>
  <li>CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States of America to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&#39;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website. The policy should state which types of information will be collected and those individuals with whom the data controller will share it.</li>
  <li>
    <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
    <p>a) users can visit our site anonymously;</p>
    <p>b) our Privacy Policy link includes the word &quot;Privacy&quot;, and you can easily find it on the home page of our website;</p>
    <p>c) we will notify users of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>
    <p>d) we allow users to change their personal information by emailing us at justice@gov.ll.land.</p>
    <p>e) We honour Do Not Track signals and do not track plant cookies or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting your web browser&#39;s Preferences or Settings page.</p>
    <p>f) If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data, and not sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:</p>

  </li>
  <li>To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.</li>
  <li>To stop selling your personal information. We don&#39;t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a &quot;sale&quot; under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time. If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers. Please note that asking us to delete or stop selling your data may impact your experience with us. You may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services that require using your personal information to function. But in no circumstances we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.</li>
  <li>Please send your request(s) by email: justice@gov.ll.land to exercise your California data protection rights described above.
