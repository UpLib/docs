# LLD/LLM Split - Explanation

## Tokenization
Tokenization is handy for modern economics.* Tokenization means giving units to something that would otherwise not be easily countable. In the old days, you had a reputation in the village for being generous and hard-working. Nowadays, you have money instead of this amorphous concept of reputation, which allows you to calculate economic issues such as local scarcity, aka. "how much does item X cost."
* Blockchains use the so-called governance token as their natural medium for power tokenization: The public blockchain is owned by the token holders and node owners.

 ## Nominated Proof of Stake
* In a nominated Proof of Stake (nPoS) system, the governance token is an even bigger deal than in other systems.
* The network security is tokenized by the governance token, as the selection of the validator for the next block is based on who holds and is willing to stake a more extensive stash of this token.
* Whatever DAO-like politics govern such a chain are likewise based on the governance token.
* Whoever has many tokens staked into them will be deciding 
  * the political matters themselves,
  * whoever will be sitting in whichever representative bodies that chain employs, and
  * how the votes will be counted, as they are likely the ones to mint the relevant block(s).

## Issues with LLM as Governance Token
* Liberland's design places LLM as the definitive tokenization of political power on the chain and in Liberland. It should be a stable "currency" of power, giving one a predictable amount of influence on Liberland's political scene.
* Governance tokens are used for that which Liberland envisions for LLM, but also for much more than that. Namely:
  * paying transaction fees,
  * forming a consensus between nodes,
  * deciding, in whichever manner, who is going to write the next block on the chain,
  * money on the chain.
 * This goes beyond the scope of what we intended with LLM.
 
 ## Politicians Counting Votes
 * As Liberland is a State, we also find a new problem: those who are likely to be influential in politics are also likely to count the votes being cast.
 * On chain, this isn't such a big problem, because a chain is anonymous and has other measures in place.
 * In a State, however, the standards for election transparency are higher. Having by the force of code-is-law dictated the concurrence of politicians also likely being vote-counters is far from optimal.
 
 ## Tokenomics
 * LLM is designed to be ultimately deflatio

nary, as it must conserve your political powers. 
 * Beyond the problems as described above, a nPoS system should be inflationary, to continuously motivate validators into making new blocks. 
 * Were this not the case, the validators would lose their motivation should the emission go down without the price going up sufficiently. The transaction fees would then grow beyond what people would reasonably be willing to pay.
 
 ## Solution
 * The obvious solution, and the one that was taken, is to split the concept of the Governance Token into:
   * The network governance coin, for validators, nominators and as money on chain, and
   * the political token.
 * In so doing, we can simultanously keep the
