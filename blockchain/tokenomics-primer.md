# Tokenomics Primer

## Division of Power
Liberland is a country and modern countries employ division of power. On a blockchain, the main concentration of power is on the node owners and those who write new blocks. In case of a nominated proof of stake (nPOS), those are the validators and nominators. In a DAO, the power of democracy in the system would directly derive from ownership of the coin which the validators and nominators use. Such a concentration of power is not desirable, as, in effect, we would ensure with mathematic certainty that those best poised to become officials in Liberland would also be those who count the votes.

To counter this, we have decided to separate the validator power from the governance power. So the two cryptos conception was born: the governance token, Liberland Merit (LLM), and the coin, Liberland Dollar (LLD).

## Liberland Merit (LLM)
### Overview
Liberland Merit (LLM) is the governance token that represents a share in the State and in nationhoood of Liberland. LLM is not a security created with the expectation of revenue; rather, it is legally something closer to one's share in a joint ownership, like with housing committees; but the LLM represents your share in your country. The governance power is connected to the LLM and there is no possibility of other governance or of separating this power from the token.

## Politpooling
In order to prevent plutocratic concentration of power, you can only utilize the LLM in politics if you vest them on a tight schedule. This vesting is called "politpooling". Politpooled LLM are locked and you can only unvest 10 percent in year, payable monthly. 

## Citizenship on the Blockchain
As a country, Liberland uses citizenship. To fulfil the requirement of governance by blockchain, citizenship must be reflected on--chain.  
When you politpool 5000 LLM, you can ask for citizenship by investment. 

## Voting Rights
Only Citizens with 5000 politpooled LLM have political rights in Liberland. In this way, Liberland replaces the usual requirements proving a personal connection to the country by this form of vesting. We can expect those who commit their funds into Liberland long-term to have a provable bond with the land and a stake in the country's success.

### Tokenomics
Inspired by Bitcoin (BTC), the LLM has a fixed maximum supply of **70 000** tokens. With the expectable losses due to lost addresses etc., this token is expected to be deflationary.

## Liberland Dollar (LLD)
