# Tokenomics Primer

## Division of Power
As all modern democratic countries, Liberland employs division of power in its government and, thereby, also on its governance blockchain. The main concentration of power on a blockchain is on the node owners and those who write new blocks - the validators. In a DAO, the power of democracy in the system would directly derive from ownership of the coin that the validators and nominators use. Such a concentration of power is not desirable, as, in effect, we would ensure with mathematic certainty that those best poised to become officials in Liberland would also be those who count the votes.

To counter this, we have separated the validator power from the governance power. So the two cryptos conception was born: the governance token, Liberland Merit (LLM), and the coin, Liberland Dollar (LLD).

## Liberland Merit (LLM)
### Overview
Liberland Merit (LLM) is the governance token representing a share in the State and nationhood of Liberland. LLM is not a security created with the expectation of revenue; instead, it is legally close to shares in joint ownership, like in case of housing cooperatives; the LLM represents one's share in their country. The governance power is connected to the LLM, and there is no possibility of other governance and no separating of this power from the token.

### Politpooling
To prevent plutocratic concentration of power, one can only utilize the LLM in politics if one vests them on a tight schedule. This vesting is called "politpooling." Politpooled LLM is locked, and the user can only unvest 10 percent in a year: payable monthly, 1/12th of 1/10th of total vested amount, each month. 

### Citizenship on the Blockchain
Liberland, as a country, acknowledges the importance of citizenship. Only Citizens with 5000 politpooled LLM have the full package of political rights associated with citizenship in Liberland. In this way, Liberland replaces the usual requirements proving a personal connection to the country through vesting. Where one should gain "honorary citizenship" for their contributions, they won't be able to vote in elections or referenda unless they also politpool. We can expect those who commit their funds to Liberland long-term to have a provable bond with the land and a stake in the country's success. 

### Tokenomics
Inspired by Bitcoin (BTC), the LLM has a fixed maximum supply of **70 000 000** tokens. With the expected losses due to lost addresses etc., this token will, in time, become deflationary. The initial price for LLM will be 1 USD, but this will change when the LLM begins to trade on the market. According to Liberland's ethos and paraphrasing Adam Smith, the price of 1 LMM will be "whatever the purchasers are willing to pay for it."

## Liberland Dollar (LLD)
### Overview
Liberland Dollar will be the second official currency of Liberland after Bitcoin (BTC) - the digital silver to BTC's digital gold. Its primary purpose will be twofold, namely:  
1. the money to purchase goods and services (mainly off-chain), hence, the medium to record market values of primarily real-world articles; and
2. the coin for validators and nominators to stake and thereby secure the chain and gain rewards, which will also be payed-out in LLD.
Please note that when we say "official currency", we mean government unit of accounting. Everybody in Liberland will be able to pay with whatever currency, barter, favors or other means of exchange the seller will accept, without any government interference.

### Tokenomics
#### General
The tokenomics of LLD resemble that of Polkadot (DOT). The system is based on Polkadot's substrate, and the team took what has worked for Parity/Web3 foundation for several years now. The main mechanisms  have been created by researchers and tested by auditors and by practice. [You can read about it in detail here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-polkadot-parameters). We will introduce the basic concepts in the remainder of this primer.

#### Initial Money Supply
The system plans to issue **2 000 000 LLD** in the beginning, which is markedly less than the initial offerings of most cryptos. Likewise to LLM, the initial price will be 1 USD per 1 LLD. Despite the name, LLD is no stablecoin but tradeable digital money, just like BTC. As such, the price will be strictly market-based.

#### Increase in Money Supply
The increase in money supply is set by the system and is constant. The initial increase is 10 percent p/a, subject to change by governance, hence, the coin holders. Coin holders are, by the virtue of their coin ownership, incentivized to keep the increase in money supply relatively low and sustainable. This increase needs to be nonzero because the higher it is, the more incentive the validators and nominators have to keep the chain decentralized.

### Validators
[Validators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking#selection-of-validators) get selected by the algorithm based on the size of their stake. Validators need to be LLD holding Citizens. Their responsibility is to [produce new block candidates](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#block-production-babe) and [finalize blocks](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#finality-gadget-grandpa). Validators are selected per epoch and inactive validators can be "slashed" by the system.

### Nominators
[Nominators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking#selection-of-validators) ensure the true decentralization of the chain. Anyone can be a nominator and becoming one is the question of having some LLD and setting up a stash. Nominators don't get reward for hosting a node, but for staking their LLD into a node of an existing Validator, hereby increasing their chance at nomination.

## Listing
The plan is to list our coins first on a decentralized exchange (DEX) of good repute early in Q2 of 2023. The team appears to gravitate towards bridging to the ETH ecosystem at the moment, but is not beyond considering other options. Decentralized exchanges of good repute are, in the opinion of the team, closer related with Satoshi's vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash than centralized exchanges.

This is nontheless a matter of convenience and adapting to existing structures. Where truly peer-to-peer solutions should be made available, e.g. not relying on smart contracts on other blockchains, those will be taken.

Listing on centralized exchanges will only be considered when the team gains the trust in the alignment of the given institution to the principles on which Liberland stands, which also includes honest business practices and solvency.
