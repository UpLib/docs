# Tokenomics Primer

## Division of Power
Liberland is a country and modern countries employ division of power. On a blockchain, the main concentration of power is on the node owners and those who write new blocks. In case of a nominated proof of stake (nPOS), those are the validators and nominators. In a DAO, the power of democracy in the system would directly derive from ownership of the coin which the validators and nominators use. Such a concentration of power is not desirable, as, in effect, we would ensure with mathematic certainty that those best poised to become officials in Liberland would also be those who count the votes.

To counter this, we have decided to separate the validator power from the governance power. So the two cryptos conception was born: the governance token, Liberland Merit (LLM), and the coin, Liberland Dollar (LLD).

## Liberland Merit (LLM)
### Overview
Liberland Merit (LLM) is the governance token that represents a share in the State and in nationhoood of Liberland. LLM is not a security created with the expectation of revenue; rather, it is legally something closer to one's share in a joint ownership, like with housing committees; but the LLM represents your share in your country. The governance power is connected to the LLM and there is no possibility of other governance or of separating this power from the token.

## Politpooling
In order to prevent plutocratic concentration of power, you can only utilize the LLM in politics if you vest them on a tight schedule. This vesting is called "politpooling". Politpooled LLM are locked and you can only unvest 10 percent in year, payable monthly. 

## Citizenship on the Blockchain
As a country, Liberland uses citizenship. To fulfil the requirement of governance by blockchain, citizenship must be reflected on--chain.  
When you politpool 5000 LLM, you can ask for citizenship by investment. 

## Voting Rights
Only Citizens with 5000 politpooled LLM have political rights in Liberland. In this way, Liberland replaces the usual requirements proving a personal connection to the country by this form of vesting. We can expect those who commit their funds into Liberland long-term to have a provable bond with the land and a stake in the country's success.

### Tokenomics
Inspired by Bitcoin (BTC), the LLM has a fixed maximum supply of **70 000 000** tokens. With the expectable losses due to lost addresses etc., this token is expected to be deflationary. The initial price for LLM will be 1 USD, but this will change when the LLM begins to trade on market. True to Liberland's ethos and paraphrasing Adam Smith, the price of 1 LMM will be "whatever the purchasers are willing to pay for it".

## Liberland Dollar (LLD)
### Overview
Liberland Dollar will be the second official currency of Liberland after Bitcoin (BTC) - the digital silver to BTC's digital gold. It's main purpose will be twofold, namely:  
1. the money to purchase goods and services (mainly off-chain), hence, the medium to record market values of primarily real-world articles; and
2. the coin for validators and nominators to stake and thereby to secure the chain and gain rewards, which will also be payed-out in LLD.

### Tokenomics
#### General
The tokenomics of LLD resemble that of Polkadot (DOT). The reason for this is that the system is based on Polkadot's substrate and we took that what seems to work and has worked for several years now. You can read about it in details here. We will introduce the basic conception in the remainder of this primer.

#### Initial Money Supply
We plan to issue **2 000 000 LLD** in the beginning, which is markedly less than the initial offerings of most cryptos. The initial price will be, likewise to LLM, 1 USD per 1 LLD. Despite the name, LLD is no stablecoin but a tradeable digital money, just like BTC. As such, the price will be strictly market based.

#### Increase in Money Supply
The increase in money supply is set by the system and is constant. The initial increase is 10 percent p/a, subject to change by governance, hence, the coin holders. Coin holders have the incentive of keeping the increase in money supply relatively low and sustainable. The reason why this increase needs to be nonzero is that the higher it is, the more incentive the validators and nominators have to keep the chain decentralized.
