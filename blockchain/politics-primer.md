## Citizenship & Political Pooling
### Explanation
At Liberland, we value freedom and commitment, and that's exactly what we expect from our citizens. The pathway to citizenship is easy to navigate and doesn't require intensive time or civic knowledge tests, unlike traditional states. Instead, we have a straightforward process that includes a voluntary tax payment. This approach establishes a commitment link between our state and our prospective citizens.

While we've kept the voluntary tax payment reasonable, we also ensure it's significant enough to demonstrate your dedication to our cause.

To maintain the integrity of our libertarian state, we have implemented a basic Know Your Customer (KYC) check. This check is designed along the lines of commercial sector practices. Once you clear these procedures, we'll notify you of your successful citizenship via email.

Your voluntary tax contribution remains in your account, which opens the doors to Liberland politics for you. Unlike other states, your contribution still belongs to you. You can gradually withdraw it or exchange it for other currencies at a rate of 10% per year. This system is our version of social security. However, while withdrawing, you won't be able to participate in elections or referenda, though you can still hold political offices.
