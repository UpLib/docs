## Order of the President of Liberland No. 1/2023: Rules of Conduct and Professionalism for the Provisional Government

### Preamble

I, Vit Jedlicka, the first President of Liberland, acting under the authority granted by ยง 11 of the Articles of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Liberland, and in recognition of the people of Liberland recently having obtained full control of our national homeland, hereby establish certain rules of conduct and higher standards of professionalism for the Provisional Government to better represent our young country.

### Article 1: Decision Making

1. The Provisional Government shall express its will through concise decisions and shall act upon those decisions once they are made.
2. Recognizing that a single weekly meeting is insufficient for the governance of a country, the Provisional Government shall establish a robust online system for making the majority of decisions asynchronously. This system shall maintain clear records of discussions leading up to decisions and of the voting on each decision.
3. Each decision shall be proposed by a minister or by me, and the proposing minister shall be responsible for recording, ensuring the formal quality and presentability, and publishing the decision. As the head of this Provisional Government and its member most directly engaged with the establishment of Liberland, I hereby delegate the responsibility for the formal quality of my decisions to the Minister of Justice during the time I am working on-site in Liberland. Similar arrangements shall be permissible for other ministers thus engaged.

### Article 2: Written Record

1. Building upon the existing practice of maintaining an agenda for government meetings, the Provisional Government shall keep records of all its decisions in a concise and professional manner. The Minister of Justice shall provide guidance on best practices as needed.
2. The Provisional Government shall publish all its decisions in accordance with my Order No. 1/2021, concerning the Decisions of the Cabinet.

### Article 3: Individual Decisions

#### Section 1: Making Individual Decisions

1. When a minister makes an Individual Decision within their portfolio using resources worth more than 300 USD, they shall first communicate this decision to the Provisional Government.
2. A communication channel for asynchronous online communication dedicated to consulting Individual Decisions shall be established and respected. Ministers and other members of the Provisional Government shall monitor this channel daily.
3. Where there are reservations or recommendations, the proposing minister shall do their best to amicably and professionally incorporate them into their Individual Decision. The time to execute an Individual Decision shall be 6 hours after the last recommendation published on the communication channel is resolved.

#### Section 2: Process of Decision Review

4. Where the Individual Decision is worth more than 300 USD but less than 10,000 USD, and there is no response within 24 hours of publishing, the minister shall assume that the Individual Decision has been confirmed without reservation and shall execute it.
5. Individual Decisions above 10,000 USD in worth shall require the explicit confirmation of either me or the entire Cabinet with me staying silent.
6. Individual Decisions worth less than 300 USD may be executed without publishing or waiting.

### Article 4: Communications

#### Section 1: Style of Communication

1. The Provisional Government members shall communicate clearly, concisely, and with the consent of each other, and shall be professional and concise in the communication originated by the Cabinet as a whole.
2. Where there is a dispute on what can be communicated, I shall be the final arbiter.

#### Section 2: Communications Process

1. The process for publishing any communication shall run on a dedicated channel for online communications which the Provisional Government shall establish for this purpose.
2. Communications that are meant to be published in the voice of the entire Cabinet shall require a Cabinet Decision, undergoing the regular Decision process.
3. Communications that are meant to be published in the voice of one minister shall undergo the process.
