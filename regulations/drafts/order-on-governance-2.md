## Order of the President of Liberland No. 2/2023: Program of the Provisional Government

I, Vít Jedlička, the first President of Liberland, acting under the authority granted by § 11 of the Articles of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Liberland, and in recognition of the people of Liberland recently having obtained full control of our national homeland, hereby issue the following Program Goals for the session of the Provisional Government that began on the 6th August 2023 by gaining full control over the land.

### Article 1: Prime Directives

#### Section 1: Keeping the Current Level of Access to the Land

1. Primary in importance and taking precedence above all else herein written or otherwise communicated, our first priority shall be to maintain at least the current level of access to the land as we have it by the time this Order enters legal force.
2. Whenever any Provisional Government member finds reasons to believe that this goal might be in any way compromised, in jeopardy, or even potentially endangered pro futuro by something already existing in the present, they shall confer this suspicion to me and the other Provisional Government members using the proper channels for urgent communication. This information shall be evaluated and examined, and I or the Provisional Government shall make a decision or decide how to proceed, with the utmost priority.

#### Section 2: Keeping Our People Healthy

1. Equal in importance to the above and governed by the same process wherever suspected or stated, it shall be of supreme importance to prevent any threats, current or potential, to the health and wellbeing of anyone and everyone currently residing in Liberland or currently being outside of Liberland but acting on behalf of the settlement. This shall be understood as extensively as reasonably possible and shall encompass illness, injury, environmental discomfort, hygiene, nutrition, clean clothing, shelter, and all other basic life necessities.
2. Secondary in importance to this but still higher than everything else shall be the health and well-being of everyone currently travelling to and from Liberland.

### Article 2: Main Goal

1. Secondary in importance to the two Prime Directives but higher in importance than any other objectives besides, the Main Goal of this Provisional Government session shall be to establish a stable and lasting settlement in Liberland, which is liable to be called a medium to low-risk investment for anyone who would wish to join us in country development.
2. All else in this order from this point on shall be understood as a binding commentary and mandatory directives set out to fulfil this Main Goal.
