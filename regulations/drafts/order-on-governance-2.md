## Order of the President of Liberland No. 2/2023: Program of the Provisional Government

I, Vít Jedlička, the first President of Liberland, acting under the authority granted by § 11 of the Articles of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Liberland, and in recognition of the people of Liberland recently having obtained full control of our national homeland, hereby issue the following Program Goals for the session of the Provisional Government that began on the 6th August 2023 by gaining full control over the land.

## Chapter 1: General Priorities

### Article 1: Prime Directives

#### Section 1: Keeping the current Level of Access to the Land

Primary in importance and taking precedence above all else herein written or otherwise communicated, our first Prime Directive shall be to maintain at least the current level of access to the land as we have it by the time this Order enters legal force.

#### Section 2: Wellbeing of our people

1. Equal in importance to the above, it shall be our second Prime Directive to prevent any threats, current or potential, to the life, health, and wellbeing of anyone and everyone currently residing in Liberland or currently being outside of Liberland but acting on behalf of the settlement. This shall be understood as extensively as reasonably possible and shall encompass illness, injury, environmental discomfort, hygiene, nutrition, clean clothing, shelter, and all other basic life necessities.
2. Secondary in importance to this but still higher than everything else set forth from this point onwards in this order or otherwise communicated by me or otherwise, shall be the health and well-being of everyone currently traveling to and from Liberland.

#### Section 3: Acting out a Prime Directive

1. Whenever any Provisional Government member finds reasons to believe that one of the two Prime Directives - or both at once - might be in any way compromised, in jeopardy, or even potentially endangered pro futuro by something already existing in the present, they shall confer this suspicion to me and the other Provisional Government members using the proper channels for urgent communication.
2. This information shall be evaluated and examined, and I or the Provisional Government shall make a decision or decide how to proceed, with the utmost priority.
3. Uniquely amongst all the goals set herein and elsewhere, we shall be personally responsible with our own time and resources to fulfill a Prime Directive where there is an urgent threat and where no other means shall clearly suffice. We shall likewise aid anyone who is currently acting to fulfill a Prime Directive and is in urgent, stated need of our help, to the best of our ability.

### Article 2: Main Goal

1. Secondary in importance to the two Prime Directives but higher in importance than any other objectives besides, the Main Goal of this Provisional Government session shall be to establish a stable and lasting settlement in Liberland, which is liable to be called a medium to low-risk investment for anyone who would wish to join us in country development.
2. All else in this order from this point on shall be understood as a binding commentary and mandatory directives set out to fulfill this Main Goal.

## Chapter 2: Minister of Interior

### Article 3: Establishing a Permanent Settlement

1. It shall be a priority of the Minister of Interior to establish the settlement of Liberland, maintain it and ensure it can expand. As a Permanent Settlement shall be understood a set of buildings, facilities, points of infrastructure, and communications, maintained by a sufficient number of regular personnel and visited regularly or used by private settlers, that allow at least the basic level of comfort for anyone to come and stay there indefinitely.
2. This goal shall be fulfilled when we can accommodate 20 plus settlers indefinitely in conditions comparable to a one-star hotel.
3. For the articles in this chapter applies that where a priority is for a time impossible for the Minister to fulfil, this responsibility shall be incumbent on me.

### Article 4: Power and power management

1. To establish and maintain a Permanent Settlement, the Minister shall move into Liberland, set up and maintain the necessary power generating and power management equipment, including and not limited to solar panels, generators for the night and for winter months, power transmission equipment, safe and state-of-the-art power transformation stations where necessary.
2. The Minister shall ensure that competent personnel is always in place or within 1 hour of Liberland to service the facilities; the desired level of service is that there shall be no power outage longer than 2 hours.
3. The Minister shall likewise expand the power supply when appropriate to allow for further settlement.

### Article 5: Clean water

1. To establish and maintain a Permanent Settlement, the Minister shall move into Liberland, set up and maintain the necessary water generating equipment to ensure a constant, steady, and sufficient supply of clean water for drinking, washing, cleaning, and cooking and using appliances which require water to function.
2. The Minister shall ensure that competent personnel is always in place or within 1 hour of Liberland to service the facilities; the desired level of service is that there shall be no power outage longer than 2 hours.
3. The Minister shall likewise expand the water supply when appropriate to allow for further settlement.

### Article 6: Waste management
