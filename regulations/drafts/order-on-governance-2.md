## Order of the President of Liberland No. 2/2023: Program of the Provisional Government

I, Vít Jedlička, the first President of Liberland, acting under the authority granted by § 11 of the Articles of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Liberland, and in recognition of the people of Liberland recently having obtained full control of our national homeland, hereby issue the following Program Goals for the session of the Provisional Government that began on the 6th August 2023 by gaining full control over the land.

### Article 1: Prime Directives

#### Section 1: Keeping the Current Level of Access to the Land

Primary in importance and taking precedence above all else herein written or otherwise communicated, our first Prime Directive shall be to maintain at least the current level of access to the land as we have it by the time this Order enters legal force.

#### Section 2: Keeping Our People Healthy

1. Equal in importance to the above, it shall be our second Prime Directive to prevent any threats, current or potential, to the life, health and wellbeing of anyone and everyone currently residing in Liberland or currently being outside of Liberland but acting on behalf of the settlement. This shall be understood as extensively as reasonably possible and shall encompass illness, injury, environmental discomfort, hygiene, nutrition, clean clothing, shelter, and all other basic life necessities.
2. Secondary in importance to this but still higher than everything else set forth from this point onwards in this order or otherwise communicated by me or otherwise, shall be the health and well-being of everyone currently travelling to and from Liberland.

#### Section 3: Acting out a Prime Directive

1. Whenever any Provisional Government member finds reasons to believe that one of the two Prime Directives - or both at once - might be in any way compromised, in jeopardy, or even potentially endangered pro futuro by something already existing in the present, they shall confer this suspicion to me and the other Provisional Government members using the proper channels for urgent communication.
2. This information shall be evaluated and examined, and I or the Provisional Government shall make a decision or decide how to proceed, with the utmost priority.
3. Uniquely amongst all the goals set herein and elsewhere, we shall be personally responsible with our own time and resources to fulfil a Prime Directive where there is an urgent threat and where no other means shall clearly suffice. We shall likewise aid anyone who is currently acting to fulfil a Prime Directive and is in urgent, stated need of our help, to the best of our ability.

### Article 2: Main Goal

1. Secondary in importance to the two Prime Directives but higher in importance than any other objectives besides, the Main Goal of this Provisional Government session shall be to establish a stable and lasting settlement in Liberland, which is liable to be called a medium to low-risk investment for anyone who would wish to join us in country development.
2. All else in this order from this point on shall be understood as a binding commentary and mandatory directives set out to fulfil this Main Goal.
