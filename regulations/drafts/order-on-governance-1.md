## Order of the President of Liberland No. 2/2023: Rules of Conduct and Professionalism for the Provisional Government

### Preamble

I, Vít Jedlička, the first President of Liberland, acting under the authority granted by § 11 of the Articles of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Liberland, and in recognition of the people of Liberland recently having obtained full control of our national homeland, hereby establish certain rules of conduct and higher standards of professionalism for the Provisional Government to better represent our young country. This order represents the first part of the Provisional Government Program and shall be followed by other orders setting out our priorities.

### Article 1: Mindset and Responsibility

#### Section 1: Collective Responsibility

1. From this moment forward, we collectively bear the responsibility for the survival and growth of our nation on this land. The magnitude of this responsibility is akin to that of C-level executives in a major corporation, and it is only set to increase.
2. As such, we are expected to adopt a professional approach commensurate with the responsibilities of such executives.

#### Section 2: Collaborative Decision-Making

1. Each Provisional Government member shall act and think with consideration for their fellow members and the needs of the Cabinet as a whole. Decisions shall be made thoughtfully, responsibly, and in consultation with others.
2. In this order, I set forth standards and procedures for certain core processes, but this shall serve only as the basis for a complex structure which we shall together establish.

#### Section 3: Systems-Based Thinking

1. You shall, from now on, act mindful that one decision means very little without it being reproducible and without being a part of a fully functioning system. By systems, I mean a set of people and instructions, including resources, game theory compatible equilibria for actions by each actor, to keep them happy for mid to long time, and clearly defined goals and outputs.
2. Any project we undertake shall include objectives and clearly defined criteria for success or failure. Systems shall likewise be set up with such criteria in mind and shall be periodically evaluated. Projects that fail shall be cancelled or replaced by reworked projects, and systems that fall short over a span of time shall likewise be revised and replaced.
3. Our people are our primary resource, and they shall never be treated as mere means to an end, however noble. We stand and fall on building our systems into a vibrant community.

### Article 2: Decision Making

1. The Provisional Government shall express its will through concise decisions and shall act upon those decisions once they are made.
2. Recognizing that a single weekly meeting is insufficient for the governance of a country, the Provisional Government shall establish a robust online system for making the majority of decisions asynchronously. This system shall maintain clear records of discussions leading up to decisions and of the voting on each decision.
3. Each decision shall be proposed by a Provisional Government member or by me, and the proposing member shall be responsible for recording, ensuring the formal quality and presentability, and publishing the decision. As the head of this Provisional Government and its member most directly engaged with the establishment of Liberland, I hereby delegate the responsibility for the formal quality of my decisions to the Minister of Justice during the time I am working on-site in Liberland. Similar arrangements shall be permissible for other Provisional Government members thus engaged.

### Article 3: Written Record

1. Building upon the existing practice of maintaining an agenda for government meetings, the Provisional Government shall keep records of all its decisions in a concise and professional manner. The Minister of Justice shall provide guidance on best practices as needed.
2. The Provisional Government shall publish all its decisions in accordance with my Order No. 1/2021, concerning the Decisions of the Cabinet.

### Article 4: Individual Decisions

#### Section 1: Making Individual Decisions

1. When a Provisional Government member makes an Individual Decision within their portfolio using resources worth more than 300 USD, they shall first communicate this decision to the Provisional Government.
2. A communication channel for asynchronous online communication dedicated to consulting Individual Decisions shall be established and respected. Provisional Government members shall monitor this channel daily.
3. Where there are reservations or recommendations, the proposing member shall do their best to amicably and professionally incorporate them into their Individual Decision. The time to execute an Individual Decision shall be 6 hours after the last recommendation published on the communication channel is resolved.

#### Section 2: Process of Decision Review

4. Where the Individual Decision is worth more than 300 USD but less than 10,000 USD, and there is no response within 24 hours of publishing, the Provisional Government member shall assume that the Individual Decision has been confirmed without reservation and shall execute it.
5. Individual Decisions above 10,000 USD in worth shall require the explicit confirmation of either me or the entire Cabinet with me staying silent.
6. Individual Decisions worth less than 300 USD

 may be executed without publishing or waiting.

### Article 5: Communications

#### Section 1: Style of Communication

1. The Provisional Government members shall communicate clearly, concisely, and with the consent of each other, and shall be professional and concise in the communication originated by the Cabinet as a whole.
2. Where there is a dispute on what can be communicated, I shall be the final arbiter.

#### Section 2: Communications Process

1. The process for publishing any communication shall run on a dedicated channel for online communications which the Provisional Government shall establish for this purpose.
2. Communications that are meant to be published in the voice of the entire Cabinet shall require a Cabinet Decision, undergoing the regular Decision process.
3. Communications that are meant to be published in the voice of one Provisional Government member shall undergo the process.

### Article 6: Information Technology Infrastructure for Cabinet Decision-Making

1. The IT infrastructure supporting the Cabinet's decision-making process shall, to the extent possible, be based on open-source solutions. The Cabinet shall collectively decide on the standardization of this infrastructure.
2. The communication platform utilized by the Cabinet shall, at a minimum, provide the following capabilities:

   a) Support for real-time, online, asynchronous communication.

   b) Direct delivery of messages to the mobile devices and computers of Provisional Government members.

   c) Organization that allows for multiple communication channels.

   d) Preservation of past communications in a synchronized and saved format to create a record of decision-making.

   e) Compliance with industry-standard privacy and security protocols.

### Article 7: Transparency and Accountability

#### Section 1: Accountability

1. The Provisional Government and its individual members shall act with full accountability, acknowledging and sharing their mistakes, amending their actions, and improving processes for the future. This responsibility extends to their personal lives, as they now represent not only their own affairs and public image but collectively represent Liberland and all those who believe in its success.
2. In interactions with the outside world, the Provisional Government and its members shall always pay their debts on time and shall neither deceive others nor take away from them things that rightfully belong to them. They shall go above and beyond to ensure this is their public image, exceeding the expectations of an honest person.

#### Section 2: Transparency

All workings, accounts, decision-making, and deliberations of the Provisional Government shall be conducted with scrutiny in mind and shall only be undertaken when, if viewed by neutral observers, they would be seen as reasonable, honest, and moral. Even actions that are reasonable, honest, and moral can appear untransparent if they do not pass the scrutiny of a neutral observer.

### Article 8: Disciplinary Action

1. As the head of the Provisional Government, I reserve the sole discretion to initiate, conduct, and make decisions regarding possible lapses in professionalism or Integrity Issues, defined as breaches in accountability and transparency.
2. If I determine that the observed issue is substantiated, I shall instruct the guilty party to rectify the situation and to repair any damage that has been caused.
3. The most severe disciplinary measure at my disposal is the summary removal of a Provisional Government member from their post, and I shall only use it in cases of extraordinarily serious Integrity Issues.

### Article 9: Legal Force

This program of the Provisional Government is hereby adopted and shall be in force from the date of its adoption.

Dated this ______ day of ______, 20.
